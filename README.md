# CapitalTek2021
CapitalTek Campaign Project 2021

CaptialTek is a Managed Service Provider for Small to Medium-sized Businesses (SMB). Sergey (CEO of CapitalTek) noticed many of his clients were asking about what Cyber Insurance is and if they needed one. Sergey also wanted to attract new clients. I suggested a campaign: a webinar, including giving out handouts post-webinar, for his clients and anyone interested in the topics about cybersecurity and cyber insurance.

Although potential clients have heard about the IT terms, if they don't understand how it applies to them, then they won't pursue strengthening their networks and acquiring good online habits. Hence, the challenge was to provide definitions of IT cybersecurity terms and concepts to a non-technical audience.

I created a presentation including notes for Sergey to use, it presents: 
- cybersecurity terms
- reveals that SMB are the main target of most cyberattacks
- misconceptions and statistics
- what to look for in a Cyber Insurance quote (as many of them don't ask the right security questions)

I also created two PDF handouts to be given to webinar participants, and potentially to be poster on social media post-webinar:
- Cybersecurity Everyday Check: a simple graphical reminder of core basic cyber-hygiene habits to be printed out as posters, just like Covid-19 posters.
- Cybersecurity Self-Assessment Checklist: a checklist of 12 cybersecurity measures (non-exclusive) that strengthen a network. For each cybersecurity measure there is a description box that attemps to explaining to a non-technical reader what the measure is.
